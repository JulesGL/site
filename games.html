            <h2>My Passion for Gaming</h2>
            <p>Gaming has been a part of my life since childhood, sparking my creativity, imagination and strategic thinking. Whether it's board games or video games, gaming has always been a way for me to relax, challenge myself, and connect with others.</p>
        
        <!-- Video Games Section -->
        <h3>Video Games: My Creative Playground</h3>
        <p>Video games have always been my playground for creativity. I love immersing myself in worlds where I can think, plan, and build from the ground up. Whether it's designing complex game engines or creating synergies, I’m fascinated by the art of strategic thinking. I particularly enjoy strategy and deckbuilding games, where every decision counts, and synergy plays a key role in success.</p>
        <p>In addition to playing, I am also deeply passionate about studying game design. I love exploring how different game mechanics interact with each other and how they are all tied to the narrative purpose of the game. It’s amazing to see how well-designed mechanics can enhance the storytelling experience, making the gameplay feel seamless and meaningful.</p>
        <p>Building intricate systems and engines in these games gives me a sense of accomplishment as I see them come to life. It’s the perfect balance of creativity and strategy!</p>
        <p>Currently, I’m deep into strategy games—especially those that allow for long-term planning and decision-making. Here are some of my favorites right now:</p>

            <h3>Board Games: Connecting Through Strategy and Play</h3>
            <p>Board games are more than just entertainment for me—they're a way to engage with friends, family, or even strangers in a fun and competitive environment. I’ve always enjoyed exploring new games, and there's always a perfect game for every occasion!</p>
            <p>I even organized a board games week at the <a href="https://catalogue-archipel.univ-toulouse.fr/primo-explore/search?vid=33ISAE_VU1&lang=fr_FR">Aérothèque @ISAE-Supaero</a>, and I'm eager to participate in more events like this!</p>
